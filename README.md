Robby McKilliam and Andre Pollok "On the Cramer-Rao bound for polynomial phase signals" submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, Aug. 2012.

You can build the plots and tex using by running the build.sh bash script.

Data from the simulations already exists in this repository (the same data as used in the paper).  If you would like the rerun the Monte-Carlo simulations use the runsim.sh script in the /code directory. You need a working java jvm and also Scala 2.9.1 or higher installed. The simulations make use of code from the PubSim library, available at

https://github.com/robbymckilliam/pubsim.

The Cramer-Rao bounds where computed using Mathematica 8.0. See the computer.nb file in the /code directory.
